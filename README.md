# Markov Decision Processes

This code is a very slightly modifed version of the assignment 4 code found here: https://github.com/cmaron/CS-7641-assignments .
I made only minor changes to the rewards of Frozen Lake.

Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To produce the outputs used in my analysis, run `python run_experiment --plot --all`. If you like, use `--threads -1` to multithread the execution of this code and potentially improve execution time.
